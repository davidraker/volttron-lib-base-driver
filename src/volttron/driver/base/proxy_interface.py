"""Base class for interfaces that speak their protocol through a Protocol Proxy process.

A proxy-backed interface does no protocol work itself. It declares the remote and its points to a proxy process
(``REGISTER_METHOD``), asks the proxy to read and write points by their full topics (``READ_METHOD``,
``WRITE_METHOD``), and publishes the values the proxy pushes back on its own initiative (``PUSH_METHOD``: a BACnet
change-of-value, a DNP3 unsolicited response, a 2030.5 control). This class owns everything those four exchanges have
in common: the shared :class:`GeventProtocolProxyManager` per protocol, the registration handshake, the reply
envelope (``{'result': ..., 'error': ...}`` from the proxy's serializer, ``{'status': 'error', ...}`` from the IPC
layer), the mapping of a reply onto per-topic results and errors, the three failure modes (unsendable request, gevent
timeout, unexpected exception) and the push callback into :meth:`DriverAgent.publish_push`.

Requests carry the instance's remote id in the header (protocol-proxy version 2), which is how the proxy knows which
registered remote a read or write concerns; the identity fields appear only in the registration payload.

Pushes are routed to the instance they concern. Each instance has a ``remote_id`` that it registers its push handler
under and sends to the proxy with the registration; the proxy tags its pushes for that remote with the same id
(protocol-proxy header version 2) and the manager delivers them to this instance's :meth:`receive_push`, which may
therefore use ``point_map`` and the rest of the instance's state (:meth:`handle_pushed`). The instance also offers
itself as the method's fallback handler for pushes without a remote id (an older proxy); only the first instance's
offer is kept, and :meth:`handle_pushed` publishes only this instance's own topics, so an untagged push for another
instance's points is dropped with a warning. Requests to the proxy carry the remote id too.

A protocol interface subclasses this, sets the class attributes, and overrides the few hooks whose defaults do not
fit: what identifies the remote (:meth:`identity_fields`), what a register contributes to the point table
(:meth:`point_fields`), how requests are batched (:meth:`split_reads`, :meth:`split_writes`), how a reply entry becomes
a value (:meth:`read_result`) and how a value is coerced before it is sent (:meth:`coerce`).

This is a mixin, listed first: ``class Dnp3(ProxyBackedInterface, BasicRevert, BaseInterface)``. In that order it
supplies the ``_set_point`` and ``_get_multiple_points`` that :class:`BasicRevert` declares abstract and defers to
BasicRevert's tracking ``set_point`` and ``get_multiple_points``; without BasicRevert
(``class BACnet(ProxyBackedInterface, BaseInterface)``) its own ``set_point`` and ``get_multiple_points`` apply and the
interface implements ``revert_point`` and ``revert_all`` itself. The interface's ``__init__`` calls
``BaseInterface.__init__`` (and ``BasicRevert.__init__``) and then :meth:`init_proxy`.

The manager watches the proxy processes it launches. When this instance's proxy exits or fails to register, the
manager tells the instance (:meth:`_proxy_peer_lost`), which forgets the peer and, after a growing delay
(``RECOVERY_DELAYS``), runs :meth:`finalize_setup` again: the first instance to do so relaunches the proxy, every
instance registers its remote again, and a server-role proxy pushes its table back. Requests made before that fail
as unsendable, as they would for any proxy that is down.

The protocol proxy library is VOLTTRON-independent; this module is the driver framework's way of using it, which is
why it lives here and ``protocol-proxy`` is an optional dependency of the base driver.
