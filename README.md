# Documentation
More detailed information about the VOLTTRON Driver Framework can be found [ReadTheDocs](https://eclipse-volttron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/external-docs/volttron-platform-driver/index.html#platform-driver-framework). The RST source
of the documentation for this component is located in the "docs" directory of this repository.

## Installation

Before installing, VOLTTRON should be installed and running.  Its virtual environment should be active.
Information on how to install of the VOLTTRON platform can be found
[here](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/volttron-core).

Install the library. You have two options. You can install this library using the version on PyPi:

```shell
poetry add --directory $VOLTTRON_HOME volttron-lib-base-driver
```

## Proxy-backed interfaces

Interfaces whose protocol runs in a [Protocol Proxy](https://github.com/eclipse-volttron/lib-protocol-proxy) process
(BACnet, Modbus, DNP3, IEEE 2030.5) share `volttron.driver.base.proxy_interface.ProxyBackedInterface`: the manager
wiring, the registration handshake, the reply envelope, the mapping of replies onto per-topic results and errors, the
timeout and failure handling, and the push callback into `publish_push`. A protocol interface lists it first,
`class Dnp3(ProxyBackedInterface, BasicRevert, BaseInterface)`, sets the message names as class attributes and
overrides the few hooks whose defaults do not fit (`identity_fields`, `point_fields`, `read_payload`, `read_result`,
`coerce`, `split_reads`, `split_writes`). `volttron.driver.base.testing` provides `FakePPM`, `serialized` and
`build_interface` for testing such interfaces without a proxy process. The protocol proxy is an optional dependency:
`pip install volttron-lib-base-driver[proxy]`.

The proxy manager watches the processes it launches. When an interface's proxy exits or never registers, the interface
is told, forgets the peer and runs `finalize_setup` again after a growing delay (`RECOVERY_DELAYS`: 1, 2, 5, 10, then
30 seconds between attempts): the proxy is relaunched and every remote registers with it again, without a platform
driver restart. Pushed values arriving by topic are checked twice, in `handle_pushed` (only the instance's own points)
and in `DriverAgent.publish_push` (only points of that remote), so a proxy can only affect the points it serves.

A remote configuration may name a `driver_role`. The default, `client`, reaches a device; a server role (`server`, or
the protocol's own word such as `outstation`) serves the configured points to a remote peer through the same interface
class and proxy. Each interface narrows the accepted values and validates the role-specific settings. In a server role
the registry's `Remote Writable` column says which served points the peer may write (defaulting from the protocol
address), while `Writable` keeps meaning that the platform may set the point; served rows default to the `server` data
source, so they are never polled.
